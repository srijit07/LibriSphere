# LibriSphere

A virtual AR library where an user can experience and see a 3D model of any object by scanning any image of the object from the internet. The model will hover in front of the user in augmented reality, which will allow the user to get to see details of the object in depth for a better understanding. 

Tech Stack: Unity-AR foundation, AR-Core, AR-Kit, C#

## Purpose

Our main goal behind this project was to enhance a better understanding of real world objects which will help people from different fields of study to gain an in-depth knowledge of an image that they do not have access to in the real world. This can be a very useful tool especially for STEM students who can have a clear understanding of different core concepts in the subjects of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science, Electronics, Civil, and many more.

## Support

As of now, this application is only available only for android.

## Limitations

Since the 3D models take a large chunk of space inside the application itself, as of now, we have incorporated only a few a models for initial release. 

Our aim is to use the entire internet as a big database for our model extraction and relay them into the application.

## Installation
